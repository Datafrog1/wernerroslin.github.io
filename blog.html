        <h2>Building This Site: A Journey Through Web Development and AI Collaboration</h2>
        <div class="date">July 4, 2025</div>
        <p>Over the past few weeks, I've explored web development, design, AI collaboration, and personal branding. I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosting it with GitHub Pages, and connecting it to my own domain: wernerroslin.fi — focusing on interaction design, and learning by doing.</p>
        
        <h3>🔧 The Stack (Totally DIY)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code editor:</strong> Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li><strong>Version control:</strong> GitHub</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> GitHub Pages</li>
            <li><strong>Domains:</strong> Purchased from Domainhotelli</li>
            <li><strong>AI Assistant:</strong> ChatGPT (yes, even this blog was written together)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>🧠 Themes I'm Exploring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can AI be a collaborator, not just a tool?</li>
            <li>What happens when I use design to provoke curiosity?</li>
            <li>How does minimalism affect engagement?</li>
            <li>Can I turn a website into a thesis?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>📌 What's Next?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>More experiments (interactive content, maybe live data)</li>
            <li>Sharing the site via social platforms</li>
            <li>Gathering feedback (good, bad, weird—everything counts)</li>
            <li>Writing the actual thesis based on what I've built and learned</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Site Makeover: From Scattered Code to Unified Architecture</h2>
        <div class="date">July 8, 2025</div>
        <p>Just pushed a major update that completely restructured how this site works under the hood. What started as separate HTML files with duplicated styles has evolved into a clean, maintainable architecture.</p>
        
        <h3>🔧 What Changed?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unified CSS:</strong> Created a single <code>styles.css</code> that handles all global styles and dark mode</li>
            <li><strong>Shared JavaScript:</strong> Added <code>scripts.js</code> for common functionality across all pages</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Mode Toggle:</strong> Every page now has a consistent theme switcher (🔄 button in top-right)</li>
            <li><strong>Battleship Game:</strong> Properly centered and responsive with full dark mode support</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> Alt+D toggles dark mode, Alt+H goes home</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🎯 Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>This isn't just about cleaner code (though that's nice). It's about creating a foundation that can scale. No more copy-pasting styles between files. No more inconsistent user experience. One change, everywhere it needs to be.</p>

        <p>The dark mode implementation is particularly interesting—it respects your system preferences but lets you override manually. Your choice persists across page visits using localStorage.</p>

        <h3>🚀 The Technical Stack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DRY Principle:</strong> Don't Repeat Yourself—shared CSS/JS eliminates duplication</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> Works without JavaScript, better with it</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-First:</strong> Responsive design that works on any screen size</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Keyboard shortcuts and semantic HTML</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔍 Behind the Scenes</h3>
        <p>This update involved touching every HTML file, consolidating hundreds of lines of CSS, and implementing a state management system for theme switching. The battleship game alone required careful CSS overrides to maintain its unique styling while integrating with the global dark mode.</p>

        <p>Working with GitHub Copilot on this refactor was like pair programming with someone who never gets tired of explaining CSS specificity rules. 🤖</p>

        <h3>✨ Try It Out</h3>
        <p>Click the 🔄 button to test dark mode, or try the keyboard shortcuts. The changes are live across the entire site. Sometimes the best updates are the ones you barely notice—everything just works better.</p>

        <h2>⚔️ Battles with AI: The Exponential Complexity of Collaborative Coding</h2>
        <div class="date">July 11, 2025</div>
        <p>Ahoy fellow developers! Today I want to share some hard-won wisdom from the trenches of AI-assisted development. What started as simple projects turned into epic battles against exponential complexity—and taught me valuable lessons about the limits and strengths of AI collaboration.</p>
        
        <h3>🎰 The Great Roulette Disaster</h3>
        <p>It began innocently enough: "Let's build a roulette game!" I thought it would be straightforward—a spinning wheel, some betting logic, maybe some animations. What I didn't anticipate was how quickly things would spiral out of control.</p>
        
        <p>Every feature request seemed simple in isolation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Add betting on specific numbers"</li>
            <li>"Include red/black betting"</li>
            <li>"Add sound effects"</li>
            <li>"Make the wheel spin realistically"</li>
            <li>"Add betting history"</li>
            <li>"Include payout calculations"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's the cruel reality: <strong>code complexity grows exponentially</strong>, not linearly. Each new feature doesn't just add its own complexity—it interacts with everything that came before. Variables multiply. State management becomes a nightmare. The AI starts suggesting increasingly convoluted solutions to problems that wouldn't exist in a well-architected system.</p>

        <h3>🧠 The Context Window Prison</h3>
        <p>AI models have a fundamental limitation: context windows. As the codebase grows, the AI loses sight of earlier decisions. It starts treating symptoms instead of causes. What began as elegant code becomes a Frankenstein's monster of patches upon patches.</p>
        
        <p>I found myself in this loop:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Request a feature</li>
            <li>AI adds more variables and complexity</li>
            <li>Something breaks elsewhere</li>
            <li>AI fixes it with even more complexity</li>
            <li>Context window fills up</li>
            <li>AI loses track of the big picture</li>
            <li>Errors start cascading</li>
            <li>🔄 Repeat until madness</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>🎮 Tetris: A Different Beast</h3>
        <p>Abandoning the roulette chaos, I pivoted to Tetris. "How hard could it be?" Famous last words of developers everywhere.</p>
        
        <p>Tetris taught me something crucial about AI collaboration: <strong>you need to understand the AI's solution before you can modify it</strong>. The game pieces aren't just individual objects—they're part of an intricate dance of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collision detection systems</li>
            <li>Line clearing algorithms</li>
            <li>Gravity and timing mechanics</li>
            <li>Rotation matrices and boundary checking</li>
            <li>Score calculation and level progression</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When I'd ask for "simple" changes like "make the pieces glow," the AI would sometimes rewrite half the rendering system. Not because it wanted to, but because that one visual change rippled through tightly coupled systems.</p>

        <h3>🗝️ The Key Insight: Reverse Engineering AI Logic</h3>
        <p>Here's what I learned: <strong>before asking an AI to modify code, spend time understanding how it solved the original problem</strong>. This isn't just good practice—it's survival.</p>
        
        <p>Questions I now ask myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What patterns is the AI using for state management?</li>
            <li>How are different systems communicating?</li>
            <li>What assumptions were made in the original architecture?</li>
            <li>Where are the tight couplings that might cause cascading changes?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Once I understood the AI's approach, collaboration became exponentially more effective. Instead of fighting against the existing patterns, I could work with them.</p>
        
        <h3>🤖 The Elephant in the Room: AI Slop</h3>
        <p>Let's be honest—there's still a <em>lot</em> of AI slop out here. Code that works but feels bloated. Solutions that are technically correct but architecturally questionable. Variables named like <code>tempVar2</code> and functions that do three different things because the AI couldn't decide.</p>
        
        <p>I still encounter this regularly. Sometimes the AI suggests patterns that make me think "this works, but feels wrong." Other times it generates perfectly functional code that just... lacks soul? It's hard to describe, but you know it when you see it.</p>
        
        <p>But hey, whatcha gonna do? 🤷‍♂️</p>
        
        <p>The way I see it: AI slop is like any other form of technical debt. You can fight it, refactor it, or learn to work around it. The key is recognizing it for what it is and making conscious decisions about when to accept it and when to push back.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes "good enough" really is good enough—especially for experiments, prototypes, or temporary features (like this pirate theme that won't last forever). Other times, you need to draw a line and insist on quality, even if it means explaining to the AI why its first suggestion won't cut it.</p>
