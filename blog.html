      <h3>Lessons in AI-Assisted Development</h3>
      <div class="date">July 11, 2025</div>
      <p>Working with AI tools like ChatGPT has revealed both the potential and limitations of current AI assistance in software development workflows.</p>
      
      <h4>Effective AI Integration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> AI excels at generating initial code structures</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Effective for debugging and optimization suggestions</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> Excellent for explaining complex concepts</li>
        <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Useful for identifying potential improvements</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Identified Limitations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Performance degrades with project complexity</li>
        <li><strong>Architectural Decisions:</strong> Requires human oversight for system design</li>
        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Cannot evaluate usability without human feedback</li>
        <li><strong>Code Quality:</strong> May prioritize functionality over maintainability</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Best Practices Developed</h4>
      <p>Successful AI collaboration requires clear, specific prompts, incremental development approaches, and maintaining human oversight for architectural decisions and user experience considerations.</p>

      <h3>The Real Talk About AI: My Love-Hate Relationship</h3>
      <div class="date">August 12, 2025</div>
      <p>Let me be brutally honest about working with AI. It's complicated. Without AI, I wouldn't have the patience for coding - but AI also drives me absolutely crazy sometimes.</p>
      
      <h4>Why I Need AI (VibeCoder Confession)</h4>
      <p>I'm what you might call a "VibeCoder." When I get excited about an idea, I want to see it happen RIGHT NOW. I don't want to spend hours debugging tiny mistakes or reading boring documentation. AI saves my sanity by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instant help:</strong> When I get stuck, AI unstucks me immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Skip the boring parts:</strong> AI handles tedious debugging stuff</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the momentum:</strong> I stay excited instead of getting frustrated</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on creativity:</strong> I think about what to build, AI helps with how</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>But AI Also Ruins Everything</h4>
      <p>Here's where it gets annoying. I'll ask for something simple like "make this button prettier" and suddenly I get 200 lines of CSS with animations, gradients, shadows, hover effects, and transforms. Dude, I just wanted it to be blue!</p>

      <h4>The Generic Factory Problem</h4>
      <p>AI loves making everything look the same. Ask for a website design and you get the same boring template: hero section, three feature cards, testimonials, call-to-action button. Where's the personality?</p>

      <h4>My AI Survival Strategy</h4>
      <p>I've learned to be very specific with AI:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Keep it simple" (repeat this 3 times)</li>
        <li>"Don't add features I didn't ask for"</li>
        <li>"Make it weird and personal, not generic"</li>
        <li>"If it takes more than 20 lines, you're doing it wrong"</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Honest Truth</h4>
      <p>AI is like that friend who always has opinions about your life choices. Sometimes helpful, sometimes overthinking everything. Without it, I'd never finish anything because I'd lose patience. With it, I have to fight to keep my projects from becoming boring.</p>

      <p>So yeah, I'm a VibeCoder powered by AI who constantly argues with AI. It's messy, but somehow it works!</p>
